Feature: Intelligent Messaging

Description:
Create a new page or section within the application titled 'Intelligent Messaging'.
This feature will allow users to input text, typically a reply to a customer or other business communication.
An AI model (should be a cost-effective and fast model) will then process this input.
The AI will modify the text to:
1.  Enhance professionalism.
2.  Ensure factual correctness based on the business's operations and information.

Output Requirements:
- The message should always output the advisor's name at the bottom.
  Example:
  Best Regards,
  Daniel Hillman
  [Selected Provider/Brand Name]
- Include a toggle or selection mechanism for the advisor to choose the provider (e.g., Tom, Polly, Winston) they are messaging on behalf of. This selection will determine the brand name used in the signature.

Goal:
Improve the quality of messages, make them more professional, and ensure they are factually accurate according to business standards, with appropriate branding.
