Feature: Enhanced Advisor Management & Permissions

Location: Manage Advisors Tab

Core Functionality:
- Users with appropriate authority can access this section.
- Ability to add or remove other users.
- Ability to manage individual page access permissions for other users.

Default Permissions (Automatically enabled for ALL users):
- Time Log
- Policy Search
- Next Cleared Batch
- Whole of Market
- IM: Intelligent Messaging (refer to intelligent_messaging_feature.txt)

Advanced Feature Permissions (Toggleable by users with elevated privileges like Lauren and James):
- Visualisations
- Summary
- Reports
- Manage Advisors (the tab itself, for granting others this level of control)

'Top Access' Toggle:
- Grants a user permissions equivalent to Lauren and James.
- Allows access to all sections, including advanced ones.
- Allows adding/removing users.
- Allows managing other users’ permissions.

User Interface for Permissions:
- Intuitive toggle switches next to each advisor's name within the Manage Advisors tab.

Behavior of Toggles:
- Real-time updates: Advisor’s access must automatically update immediately when a toggle is changed.
- Persistence: Permissions must persist across user sessions and be accurately reflected upon login.

Integration Notes:
- This will likely replace or significantly enhance the existing advisor management functionality.
- Consider the current `AdvisorManager` component in `src/app/page.tsx` and its `isCurrentUserAdmin` check.
