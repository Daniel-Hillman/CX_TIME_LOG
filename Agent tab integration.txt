Objective: Integrate the AgentPage component (from src/app/agent/page.tsx) into the main page (src/app/page.tsx) by replacing the existing "IM Compose" tab.

File to modify: src/app/page.tsx

Detailed Steps:

1.  **Add Import Statement:**
    *   Add the line: `import AgentPage from '@/app/agent/page';`
    *   Placement: This should go near the other component imports, specifically after the line `import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';` (which is around line 38 in the original file).

2.  **Modify the TabsTrigger for "IM Compose":**
    *   Locate the <TabsTrigger> associated with "IM Compose". It currently has `value="intelligent-messaging"`.
    *   Change the `value` attribute from `"intelligent-messaging"` to `"agent"`.
    *   Change the displayed text from "IM Compose" to "Agent Tools". The Brain icon can remain.
    *   The `userPermissions?.canAccessIntelligentMessaging` condition will still gate this tab.

3.  **Modify the TabsContent for the main feature display:**
    *   Locate the <TabsContent> immediately following the <TabsTrigger> modified in step 2. It currently has `value="intelligent-messaging"` and contains a placeholder Card.
    *   Change the `value` attribute from `"intelligent-messaging"` to `"agent"`.
    *   Replace the entire inner content of this <TabsContent> (which is currently a <Card>...</Card> structure) with the component `<AgentPage />`.

4.  **Modify the TabsContent for the "Access Restricted" message:**
    *   Locate the <TabsContent> further down that also has `value="intelligent-messaging"`. This is the one that displays the "Access Restricted" message.
    *   Change its `value` attribute from `"intelligent-messaging"` to `"agent"`.
    *   Optionally, update the text "You do not have permission to use Intelligent Messaging." to "You do not have permission to use Agent Tools." for clarity.

This plan ensures that the new "Agent Tools" tab, containing the AgentPage functionality, correctly replaces the old "IM Compose" tab, while respecting the existing permission structure.
